# MycetOS Series 5 - The Benzimidazoles

This is the fifth series of compounds being investigated by Open Source Mycetoma ("MycetOS").

After screening the Pandemic Response Box, two benzimidazoles were found to be able to prolong larval survival in _Madurella mycetomatis_ infected larvae. Furthermore all three also showed some acivity against _Falciformispora senegalensis_, another prominent mycetoma causative agent.
